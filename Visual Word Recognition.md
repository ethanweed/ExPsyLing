“From word superiority to interactive activation.
One of the most intriguing problems in reading science is how the reader’s knowledge of orthographic units is used in skilled reading (Grainger, this volume). The long‐standing answer is that readers come to recognize a word as a whole unit rather than a string of letters. J.M. Cattell’s famous experiments (1886; reviewed in Huey 1908) were intended to demonstrate this. After viewing a briefly exposed string of letters, Cattell attempted to report all the letters in the string. When the letters spelled a word, he could report more letters than when he viewed a random letter string.
In fact, Cattell’s experiments could not distinguish perception of the whole word from memory for some of its letters. Remembering enough letters would prompt retrieval of a word that contains them, making the report of the letter string a mix of perception, memory, and a bias to respond with words. Nevertheless, Cattell’s explanation (and Huey’s) stood unchallenged until the independent publications of experiments by Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970).
Reicher (1969) and Wheeler (1970) controlled for response bias by asking participants which of two letters had been briefly presented (and masked) in a particular position[…]”
