Maybe start with Sternberg experiement after all. There is so much that can be done with those data:
- t-tests
- regressions
- DAGs?
- simulations
- understanding rt as a measure of cognition



Or.. start by building up a Lexical Decision task simulation based on the literature. Hmm..?
	- look at previous articles doing lexical decision, and see:
		- what RT's tend to be
		- what effect size manipulations tend to have.
		- e.g. frequency effects / length effects
		- build simulation based

We can use this simulation project to talk about e.g.:
	- Where do experiment ideas come from?
	- How many participants do I need?
	- How can I use simulations to inform my understanding of the generative system?

Today I started playing around with simulating lexical decision data based on data reported in Ratcliff et al (2004). I think this could be very valuable. Students can learn to simulate data themselves by finding their own articles and contributing. Then we can build a database of RT data and do a kind of meta analysis by combining the mean RT's and SD's to build our intuitions about the word recogition system and the generative model that produces these data. E.g. what is the role of frequency?

Made a video on simulation. An hour long. I think I may make another on estimating frequency effects based on simulations. Perhaps taking data from table 3 from Ratcliff paper and comparing RT's for correct responses on HF vs LF words over the 6 experiments they ran. Make functions to simplify data input.

Also: make a video on loops / list comprehensions
