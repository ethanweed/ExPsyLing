Maybe start with Sternberg experiement after all. There is so much that can be done with those data:
- t-tests
- regressions
- DAGs?
- simulations
- understanding rt as a measure of cognition



Or.. start by building up a Lexical Decision task simulation based on the literature. Hmm..?
	- look at previous articles doing lexical decision, and see:
		- what RT's tend to be
		- what effect size manipulations tend to have.
		- e.g. frequency effects / length effects
		- build simulation based

We can use this simulation project to talk about e.g.:
	- Where do experiment ideas come from?
	- How many participants do I need?
	- How can I use simulations to inform my understanding of the generative system?
