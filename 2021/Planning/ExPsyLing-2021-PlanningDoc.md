### [[Literature]]
- Psycholinguistics: Talking the Talk (Harley, 2010) 
- Experimental Design and Analysis: Learning Statistics with Python (Navarro and Weed, 2021) https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/landingpage.html

### Thoughts
- focus on the skills students will need to conduct own research: 
	- experimental design
	- data wrangling
	- analysis methods
- experiments should be closely tied to basic psycholinguistic content
- build from *structure of meaning* -> *accessing meaning from words* -> *building internal meaning structures from text*
- use videos and screencasts
	- especially for statistics / Python
	- also for concepts?
- weekly [[warm-up questions]] to see what students understand and what I need to explain better
- parallel courses: lecture and lab
	- lecture: focus on theoretical part: psycholinguistics, experimental design, hypothesis testing, cognitive constructs

- [ ] Think about what the portfolio assignments should be: how many, what are the goals for the assignments, etc.
