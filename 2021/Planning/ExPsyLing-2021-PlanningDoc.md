[[Portfolio assignments]]

### [[Literature]]
- Psycholinguistics: Talking the Talk (Harley, 2010) 
- Experimental Design and Analysis: Learning Statistics with Python (Navarro and Weed, 2021) https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/landingpage.html

### Thoughts
- focus on the skills students will need to conduct own research: 
	- experimental design
	- data wrangling
	- analysis methods
- experiments should be closely tied to basic psycholinguistic content
- build from *structure of meaning* -> *accessing meaning from words* -> *building internal meaning structures from text*
- use videos and screencasts
	- especially for statistics / Python
	- also for concepts?
- weekly [[warm-up questions]] to see what students understand and what I need to explain better
- parallel courses: lecture and lab
	- lecture: focus on theoretical part: psycholinguistics, experimental design, hypothesis testing, cognitive constructs

- [x] Think about what the portfolio assignments should be: how many, what are the goals for the assignments, etc.

### Course Outline
- Week 1 (INTRO WORKSHOP)
	- Introductory workshop: How to be a Computer Power-User
	- Kristoffer Nielbo
	- U-cloud, file structure, command line, etc.

- [[Week 2]] (COURSE INTRODUCTION)
	- Lecture
			- Introduction to Experimental Psycholinguistics
				- What is psycholinguistics?
				- What are experiments?
				- Why should you care?
			- Reading: [[Harley_Chapter1]]
		- Lab
				- Introduction to Python (Reading: [N&W Part 2 Chapter 1](https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/02.01-getting_started_with_python.html)
		- [ ] write Basic programming chapter
		- Instructor
				- Exercises in exploring data with Python

- [[Week 3]] (WORKING MEMORY AND DATA WRANGLING)
	Lecture
		- [[working memory]]
		- [[Sternberg experiment]]
	- Introduction to Experimental Design
		- Reading: [N&W Part 1 Chapter 2](https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/01.02-studydesign.html?highlight=experimental)
		- [[data wrangling]] (maybe make a screencast of beginning data wrangling with Python)
			- Making data frames with Pandas
			- Wide format vs Long format
			- Adding columns to a dataframe
			- etc.
	- Instructor
		- exercises in data wrangling with Pandas 

- Week 4 (HYPOTHESIS TESTING) (STERNBERG LAB REPORT DUE)
	- Hypothesis-testing: [N&W Part 4 Chapter 4](https://ethanweed.github.io/pythonbook/04.04-hypothesis-testing.html#hypothesis-testing)
	- What can we conclude from the original [[Sternberg experiment]]?
	- What can we conclude from our own [[Sternberg experiment]] results?
	- What did the students last year find in their [[Sternberg experiment]] data?
	- [[Descriptive statistics]]

- Week 5 (HOW DO WE REPRESENT MEANING COGNITIVELY?)
	- Feedback on lab reports -> make a rubric and do peer feedback
	- [[Harley_Chapter5]]
	- [[Collins & Quillian 1969]]
	- [[Meaning representation]]
	- [[linear models]]
	- [[sentence verification task]]
	- [ ] Build Collins and Quillian sentence verification task in OpenSesame and upload to JATOS server.

- Week 6 
	- 1-way repeated measures ANOVA
	- Analysis of [[sentence verification task]] data

- Week 7 (COLLINS AND QUILLIAN LAB REPORT DUE)
	- Accessing the meaning of words
	- [[lexical decision task]]


- Week 8

- Week 9

- Week 10
	- Understanding words in context
	- Ties in with [[working memory]]
	- [x] Find a final experiment that ties in working memory and understanding words in context 
- Week 11

- Week 12

- Week 13 (extra buffer week?)
	- maybe use for individual advising meetings?


---------------------------------------- 


- Chapter 5: Meaning [[Harley_Chapter5]]
		- [[sentence verification task]] 
- Chapter 6: Words [[Harley_Chapter6]]
