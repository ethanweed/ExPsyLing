 Getting started :
	- Week 1
		- Intro workshop with Kristoffer

	 - Week 2
		- Lecture:  Introduction to the course
		- Lab:
	
	- Introduction to labs

- GDPR course

 Week 3

- Lecture
	
	- **What is Psycholinguistics?**

- Lab
	
	- Basic Concepts in Experimental Design
	
	- Python exercises

 Working memory and Operationalization of Theory

 Week 4

- Lecture
	
	- **What is working memory and why shoud we care?**

- Lab
	
	- Python exercises

 Week 5

- **Sternberg lab report**
	
	- Main goals
		
		- Think about the relationship between theory and experiment
		
		- What does reaction time represent theoretically? It is an operationalization of cognitive “work”.
		
		- Get a feeling for how we use plots to understand our data and relate them to theoretical concepts
	
	- Use last year’s data…??
	
	- Make a plot (like this, but with Seaborn)
		
		- 
	
	- Analysis
		
		- Don’t do inferenctial statistics
		
		- Calculate descriptive statistics
		
		- Analyze based on figure alone
			
			- 
				
				- inferential stats can wait!
			
			- More important to understand one’s data!
	
	- Walk the students through the analysis
		
		- data cleaning
		
		- getting data into a Pandas data frame
		
		- making the figure with Seaborn
	
	- Skills needed
		
		- Open and save a Jupyter notebook
		
		- Import data from a csv file
		
		- Clean data
		
		- Arrange data in a Pandas dataframe
		
		- Make a plot with Seaborn
		
		- Calculate descriptive statistics

- Lecture

- Lab
	
	- Do Sternberg task in class
	
	- Python exercises

 Week 6

- Lecture

- Lab

- Midsemester course evaluation

 Meaning

 Week 7

- Lecture
	
	- **How do we represent meaning cognitively?**

- Lab
	
	- Python exercises

 Week 8

- **Collins and Quillian lab report**
	
	- Sentence verification task
		
		- “A pine is a church” is easier to reject than “A pine is a flower”
		
		- Response time
		
		- Design: 2x2 ANOVA: 
			
			- Factor 1: Sentence type
				
				- Level 1: Properites
				
				- Level 2: Categories
			
			- Factor 2: Semantic hierarchy level
				
				- Level 1: 0
				
				- Level 2: 1

- Lecture

- Lab

 Lexical access

 Week 9

- Lecture
	
	- **How do we access words?**

- Lab

 Week 10

- **Meyer, D. E., & Schvaneveldt et al lab report**
	
	- Lexical decision task
		
		- hook://file/1rVjDJr8d?p=UGxhbm5pbmcvUERGcw==&n=MeyerSchvaneveldt1971.pdf
		
		- Task: two words, one above the other. Press yes if they are both words, no if one of them is not a word
		
		- Factor 1: Words vs non-words
		
		- Factor 2: Related words vs unrelated words
		
		- Two t-tests?

 Designing experiments

 Week 11

- Learn about estimation / simulation

 Week 12

- Course evaluation

- Design your own experiment
	
	- Introduction and Methods sections for an experiment
	
	- Maybe estimate data for results section?

 Week 13
