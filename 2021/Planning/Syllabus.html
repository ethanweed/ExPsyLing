<h2 id="course-goals">Course Goals</h2>
<p>In this course, we will learn to use experimental methodology to investigate some of the cognitive phenomena that support language. More specifically, we will investigate the cognitive systems involved in working memory, in the categorization of meaning, in accessing our lexical representations, and understanding language in context.</p>
<p>If these things sound complicated and abstract, that’s because they are! The mind’s chief activity “… consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing but itself to know itself with.” (Bierce, 1911). We can think all day about how the mind works, but to test our theories, we need to probe the mind experimentally.</p>
<p>To conduct psycholinguistic experiments, we need to translate theories to research hypotheses, and research hypotheses to statistical hypotheses. Put another way, we need to figure out how design experiments that will let us measure invisible things in the mind that might or might not even exist. Yikes! And once we do an experiment and write some numbers down, we have to make sense of those numbers in relation to our theories.</p>
<p>The aim of the course is for you to learn to: 1. Understand the relationship between theoretical concepts and data 2. Operationalize theoretical concepts experimentally through measurable indices 3. Analyze and interpret findings in a critical way 4. Communicate experimental findings in a clear way to both expert and lay audiences</p>
