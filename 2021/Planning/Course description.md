Description of qualifications
Purpose:
The purpose of the course is to enable students to 1) grasp the relationship between theoretical concepts and data that they collect and analyse, 2) operationalize theoretical concepts experimentally through measurable indices, 3) analyse and interpret their findings in a critical way, and 4) communicate their findings in a clear way to both expert and lay audiences.

The course explores cognitive constructs purported to support language from a variety of perspectives, including the psychological reality of these constructs, their experimental operationalization, and the tools needed to investigate them quantitatively. The course has a strong lab component, in which students carry out independent or semi-independent research. To that end, the course will familiarize students with digital methods for data collection (e.g. online experiments and surveys), data analysis, and critical data interpretation. Specific research topics can vary from semester to semester.

By developing skills in quantitative analysis and digital data collection, the course prepares students for the MA course on Computational Linguistics, and for thesis projects applying quantitative and experimental methods. The course prepares students to work in careers that rely on experimental and statistical methods.

Academic objectives:
In the evaluation of the studentâ€™s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:

Knowledge:
- demonstrate understanding of concepts central to psycholinguistics
- reflect critically on the relationship between theoretical constructs in psycholinguistics and the data that support them.

Skills:
- operationalize theoretical concepts for measurement and experimentation
- design studies to investigate theoretical questions about language and cognition
- collect, analyse, and evaluate data using digital tools.

Competences:
- communicate the results of experimental psycholinguistic research.
