Academic objectives:
In the evaluation of the studentâ€™s performance, emphasis is placed on the extent to which the student is able to:

Knowledge:
- demonstrate understanding of concepts central to psycholinguistics
- reflect critically on the relationship between theoretical constructs in psycholinguistics and the data that support them.

Skills:
- operationalize theoretical concepts for measurement and experimentation
- design studies to investigate theoretical questions about language and cognition
- collect, analyse, and evaluate data using digital tools.

Competences:
- communicate the results of experimental psycholinguistic research.


1. Grasp the relationship between theoretical concepts and data that they collect and analyse. This will be done by:
	1.  Reading about theoretical concepts in Harley
	2. Discussing the theoretical concepts from Harley
	3. Reading and discussing an experiment that Harley draws on

2.  Operationalize theoretical concepts experimentally through measurable indices. This will be done by:
	1.  Participating in an online version of the experiment from Harley
	2.  Debriefing: discussing the experience of being a participant
3.  Analyse and interpret their findings in a critical way
	1.  Analyzing the results of the online experiment
	2.  Discussing the results of the analysis
4.  Communicate their findings in a clear way to both expert and lay audiences. This will be done by:
	1.  [Lab reports]([Experimental Report Template.doc](hook://file/zv6qKN6qL?p=MjAyMS9SZXNvdXJjZXM=&n=Experimental%20Report%20Template.doc)) from each of the experiments.
