# The language machine: Psycholinguistics in review

> Psycholinguistics is, as Wilhelm Wundt (1832–1920) noted in Die
> Sprache (1900), as much about the mind as it is about language.

> The year 1957 was something of a watershed for
> psycholinguistics, not because of the publication of Verbal
> behaviour, but because of the publication of Chomsky’s Syntactic
> structures (1957)—a monograph devoted to exploring the notion of
> grammatical rules. Subsequently, in his review of Skinner’s
> Verbal behaviour, Chomsky (1959) laid to rest the behaviourist
> enterprise (at least as it applied to language).

> Chomsky reintroduced the mind, and speci􏰜cally mental
> representation, into theories of language

> Behaviourism was ‘out’, and with it associationism also.
> Symbolic computa- tion was ‘in’, but with it, uncertainty over
> how the symbolic system was acquired

> In 1986 Rumelhart and McClelland published Parallel distributed
> processing

> ‘Knowledge’ in connectionist networks is encoded as patterns of
> connectivity distributed across neural-like units, and
> ‘processing’ is manifest as spreading patterns of activation
> between the units.

> These networks can learn complex associative relations largely
> on the basis of simple associative learning principles (e.g.
> Hebb, 1949)

> Not surprisingly, the entire enterprise came under intense
> critical scrutiny from the linguistics and philosophy
> communities (see e.g. Marcus, 1998a, 1998b; Pinker & Mehler,
> 1988), not least because it appeared to reduce language to a
> system of statistical patterns, was fundamentally
> associationist, and eschewed the explicit manipulation of
> symbolic structures: the internal representations that emerged
> as a result of the learning process were not symbolic in the
> traditional sense.

> For example, children may be able to work out that, among the
> sounds in the spoken utterance ‘look, the dog’s playing with a
> ball’, the sounds corresponding to ‘dog’ are intended to
> correspond to the animal in front of them (perhaps because they
> already know that ‘ball’ refers to the ball, and have a
> suf􏰜cient grasp of syntax to realize that ‘dog’ is a noun and
> will hence refer to something). But children must still work out
> whether ‘dog’ corresponds to the concept associated with dogs,
> or with animals more generally; or to things of that shape, or
> to things of that colour; or to its head, or to all of it.

> Somehow, words are learned and their meanings acquired, and the
> result of this learning process is a mental lexicon in which
> each of 60 000 to 75 000 words can be distinguished uniquely
> from each of the others on a variety of dimensions.

> An early insight into the processes of lexical access was that
> lexical representations are not like dictionary entries to be
> accessed, but are representations to be activated (Morton, 1969,
> 1970).
