> He sent Galileo, the great Italian scientist, a letter about it.

> letter about it.

> She tested their memory after 0, 80, and 160 intervening
> syllables – equivalent to about 0, 25, or 50 seconds. She found
> that unless people were tested immediately they couldn’t tell
> the original from the first two variants, which each change the
> syntax of the original. In contrast, they were able to
> distinguish the original from the final version, which changes
> the meaning of the original, even after some time had elapsed.
> This result confirms our intuition: people usually dump the
> details of the wording and syntax as soon as they’ve extracted
> the meaning, but retain the meaning for some time.

> Students remember material from lectures well for a couple of

> This conclusion is consistent with the work on eye-witness

> Walter Kintsch’s construction–integration model (Kintsch, 1988).

> We construct the propositionally network incrementally. As new
> material comes in, we integrate it with the propositional
> network.

> We keep some proposi- tions active in our working memory; these
> are the most recent, and what we consider to be the most
> important. Given its limited capacity, we can only keep a few
> propositions active in working memory at any time; it’s these
> that we find easier to find the antecedents for when we come
> across an anaphor.

> The construction–integration model also predicts the ease with
> which we can read different sorts of material: text that makes
> it easy to construct a network, and that is constructed so that
> key propositions are likely to remain active in focus in work-
> ing memory, should be the easiest to read.

> Material that keeps on bringing up different material that isn’t
> in working memory, but that instead has to be inferred or
> brought from the network into working memory (by a process
> called a reinstatement search), is more difficult (Kintsch &
> Vipond, 1979).

> Individual differences in working memory span affect reading
> skill; clearly, the larger the span, the easier the person is
> going to find reading to be (Daneman & Carpenter, 1980).
