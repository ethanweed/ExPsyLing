> Are there any answers in psycholinguistics? This might strike

> I used text- books for physics and chemistry, and they were
> stuffed full of answers; they were full of what we know. But
> psychology texts, particularly I think ones in
> psycholinguistics, aren’t like that. Of course there must be
> answers to all our questions, but we often don’t yet know what
> they are. Or rather, different people think they know the
> answers, but they often can’t agree on what these answers are.
> So psycho- linguistics texts are full of conflicting accounts,
> each account apparently being bolstered by experiments finding
> contradictory results. Another psycholinguist might argue about
> why you got that particular result; perhaps you didn’t do that
> experiment quite properly, perhaps you forgot to take into
> account how common the words you used are, perhaps you didn’t
> make the task quite difficult enough; or perhaps the findings of
> your experiment are just a special case, and my account is more
> general, subsuming your findings and explaining when we get them
> – and when we don’t. The list of excuses can be pretty big when
> you put your mind to it. I have a memory of a television show
> where two puppets repre- senting celebrities would stand in a
> ring and start fighting; one would get knocked down, get up, and
> then knock the other one down, and this process would be
> repeated several times. Psycholinguistics is like that. It’s
> rare for a researcher to say “you’re right! I’m wrong”; after
> being set an apparently insuperable hurdle, they’ll be back. So
> there are some answers in psycholinguistics, but not as many as
> there should be, and we will come across many occasions where
> researchers have exactly opposite views. And that’s one reason
> why psycholinguistics is not for wimps.

> What is an explanation?

> What constitutes a good explanation in psycholinguistics? What
> would make a psycholinguist dance with joy? We carry out
> experiments and collect masses of numerical data, and then what?

> We want a model of our experimental results. A model is an
> account that explains the data we’ve collected, but which goes
> beyond it.

> A theory is a more overarching account covering a wider range of
> phenomena and results. We might have a model of the time it
> takes to recognise a word, but a theory of word recogni- tion in
> general.

> Quite often psychological models are based on metaphors. For
> example, we could have a model for how we search the mental
> dictionary based on a library, with words stored in particular
> places on mental shelves and a catalogue system for looking them
> up. Indeed, one of the best known models of word recognition,
> the serial search model, uses this analogy

> One of the most commonly used metaphors in psycholinguistics is
> that of activation; you’ll read about some words having a high
> activation level and others a low one, and words being in
> competition and the most highly activated one winning.
> Activation is a quantity rather like energy or temperature; some
> items have a lot, some not very much, but it’s a continuous
> scale.
