> METHOD

> The sentences were displayed one at a time

> two index fingers resting on the two response buttons.

> The sentences were grouped in runs of 32 or 48, with a rest
> period of approximately 1 min between runs.

> Each sentence appeared on the CRT for 2 see, and was followed by
> a blank screen for 2 sec before the next sentence.

> he S was instructed to press one button if the sentence was
> generally true, and the other button if it was generally false,
> and he was told to do so as accurately and as quickly

> Sentences. There were two kinds of semantic hierarchies used in
> constructing sentences for the experiments, 2-level and 3-level.
> In Fig. 1, a 2-level hierarchy might include bird, canary, and
> ostrich and their properties, whereas the whole diagram
> represents a 3-level hierarchy. A 2-level hierarchy included
> true PO, P1, SO and S1 sentences; a 3-level hierarchy included
> true P2 and $2 sentences as well. Examples of sentence sets with
> 2-level and 3-level hierarchies are given in Table 1.4 As
> illustrated in Table 1, equal numbers of true and false
> sentences were always present (but in random sequence) in the
> sentences an S read. Among both true and false sentences, there
> are the two general kinds: Property relations (P), and superset
> relations (S).

> he sequence of sentences the S saw was randomly ordered, except
> for the restriction to four hierarchies in each run. The runs
> were counterbalanced over Ss with respect to the different
> sentence types, and each button was assigned true for half the
> Ss, and false for the other half.

> To evaluate the differences shown there for true sentences, two
