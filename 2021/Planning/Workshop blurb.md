Computers are an invaluable tool for doing modern academic research. Your computer is an extraordinarily powerful device that is very good at doing the kinds of things that humans tend to not be very good at: quickly performing the mind-numbing, repetitive tasks that are often a barrier between data and insight: no matter whether your data consists of texts, images, audio files, whatever... computers are the tools we use to deal with data, so that we humans can do what we _are_ good at: thinking, considering, evaluating, and placing data in context.

You will use computers throughout your Master's degree program, although perhaps most intensely in the courses _Experimental Psycholinguistics_ and _Computational Linguistics_. You don't need to be a computer whiz to complete either of the courses, but experience tells us that you will get more out of the courses if you begin with a certain level of familiarity with your computer.

This is why we have invited the Center for Humanities Computing Aarhus to provide a three-day workshop to get you up to speed on using your computer as the tool it is. The background you get from this workshop will help us spend less class time on the basics, so we can get right to the good stuff!
