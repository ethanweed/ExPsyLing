Designers of blue jeans often want to treat areas of the jeans to give them a faded look by blasting them with quartz sand under high pressure. The areas to be treated with sand need to be marked out; this is traditionally done by hand with a pen, but this is very time-consuming. A quicker way would be to use lasers to mark the areas, but how does this affect the strength and stretchability of the material? To test this, the authors treated 20 pairs of jeans with each design method, then took 3 samples from different parts of each pair of jeans, giving a total sample size of N = 2(20)(3) = 120. The samples were tested for tensile strength and extension by pulling the fabric samples between two hooks until they ripped.\n",
