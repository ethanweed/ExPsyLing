    "\n",
    "1. If the data is not displayed as a table, `pd.read_html` will not work.\n",
    "2. If the data is displayed as a table, but it is dynamically generated, `pd.read_html` will also not work\n",
    "3. If you can find data stored online in a `.csv` file, you may be able to use `pd.read_csv` instead. E.g., try `d = pd.read_csv(\"http://bmd.mortality.org/Sweden/Births/births\")`\n",
    "4. Sometimes the data is online, and you should be able to read it in with `pandas`, but there is something messed up with the formatting of the data, and `pandas` can't figure out how to put it in a dataframe. In this case, you may need to download the file to your computer, figure out what is wrong with it, fix it, and then read the file in directly using `pd.read_csv`.\n",
    "5. If all else fails, you can always just copy/paste data from the web e.g. into Excel or Google Sheets, export it as a csv, and read it into pandas from there.\n",
    "6. CSV files are \"comma-separated\", that is, they use commas to separte the columns, but sometimes they use other things, like tabs or spaces or semicolons. You can tell `pd.read_csv` what the separater is. E.g. compare what happens if you do this: `d2 = pd.read_csv(\"http://bmd.mortality.org/Sweden/LifeTables/e0.1x1\")` and look at the data or if you do this: `d2 = pd.read_csv(\"http://bmd.mortality.org/Sweden/LifeTables/e0.1x1\", sep='\\t')` and look at the data."
