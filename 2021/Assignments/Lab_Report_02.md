#### Lab Report 02: Lexical Decision Task

The purpose of this second lab report is for you to practice organizing data in a dataframe, exploring a dataset, and choosing an appropriate statistical test to do.

**Introduction:**  For background literature, you can draw on Harley chapter 6, the paper by Meyer & Schvaneveldt (1971), the references from the lecture slides, and any other sources you would like to include

**Materials and Methods:** The experiment was a lexical decision task, and the stimuli were taken from Besner, D., Smith, M. C., & MacLeod, C. M. (1990). Visual word recognition: A dissociation of lexical and semantic processing. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, memory, and cognition, 16(5), 862.).

Whle preparing the experiment, I made the following notes:

ISI: 500 ms
fixation: 500 ms
stimulus: inf
keyboard response: yes/no

#### Lab Report 02: Lexical DecisionTask

60 critical items + 20 filler items
20 related word pairs, 20 unrelated word pairs, 20 nonword pairs

Because the nonwords were derived from real words in the experiment, participants were randomly divided into three groups: A, B, and C to reduce the effect of seeing many similar non-word/word pairings. To the extent possible, participants did not see nonwords that were derived from real words that were seen by the same participant.

---------------------------------------- 

Stimuli taken from Besner et al (1990)

Changed: 
"sko" to "sku" (real word in Danish)
"lort" to "lont" (real word in Danish)
"suet" to "soet" ("suet" is a real word in English, but Besner lists it as a nonword)

Removed: 
"lige" (real word in Danish)
"frue" (real word in Danish)
"halse" (real word in Danish)

---------------------------------------- 



**Analysis and Results:** There are many possibilities for analyses. The primary comparison is the response time between the related and unrelated real word pairs, but we also have data on the individual word pairs, and on the words vs non-words. Percent correct could also be derived, and we have two groups of participants: semiotics students and linguistics students.

**Discussion:** How do you interpret our results in terms of the themes outlined in the introduction? What ideas have been supported or not supported by our results? What limitations have their been in our study? What reccomendations do you have for future research that could help overcome these limitations? You don't have to have any deep insights: the important thing is to take the assignment seriously, and think about what we can and cannot conclude based on our design and results.
