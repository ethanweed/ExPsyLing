#### Memory scanning task (Sternberg, 1966)

---

**Research Question: Do people have immediate (parallel) access to all of short-term memory?**

Sternberg (1966) task:
-Participant is given a list consisting of N digits (N = 1,... , 6)
	- these digits are called the memory set
- The participant is allowed to rehearse this list
- A few seconds later, the participant sees a single digit
	- this number is called the probe
- The participant must indicate whether the probe digit IS or
IS NOT contained in the memory set

---

#### Experiment structure

**Practice block and experimental block**

**Trial structure**

- fixation (1000 ms)
- present memory set (1200 ms)
- ISI (2000 ms)
- present probe (until response)
- feedback (1000 ms)

###### Experiment structure

Stimulus manipulations
 - memory set size N = 1,...,6
 - probe present or absent
 - position of probe in list
 - three repetitions of each condition

**Experimental trials**

|   N | probe conditions | positions | reps | # trials |
| --: | ---------------: | --------: | ---: | -------: |
|   1 |                2 |         T |    3 |        6 |
|   2 |                2 |         2 |    3 |       12 |
