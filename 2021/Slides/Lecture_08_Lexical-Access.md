### The lexicon

- contains entries for all the words we know
- contains no entries for words we don't know

Proficient speakers of a language can read both words and pseudowords.

How do they do it?

### Aspects of lexical access

- Recognition
- Identification
- Understanding
- Naming


---

### Recognition

The word is familiar:

- NIGHT is a word
- NITE is not

---

### Identification

The word is distinguished from other words:

NIGHT is...

 - not MIGHT 
 - not NIGHTTIME
 - not NIGH
 - not KNIGHT


---

### Understanding

NIGHT = the time from sunset to sunrise

---

### Bottom-up vs. top-down processing



---

### Dual-route model


::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
"...there is also the question of reading. We read in two ways; the new or unknown word is scanned letter after letter, but a common or familiar word is taken in at a glance, without bothering about the individual letters: its visual shape functions like an ideogram." -de Saussure, quoted in Coltheart, M. (2005)

### Problems with dual-route model

- Phonological neighborhood effects
- Phonological priming effects

---

### Phonological neighborhood effects

::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
A nice quiet neighborhood:
GAVE  
SAVE  
RAVE  
CAVE
::::
:::: {.col}
A sketchy neighborhood:  
HAVE

### Lexical neighborhood effects

Nonword "Access" ~  lexical neighborhood effects + $\epsilon$

Lexical access for _regular words_ ~  lexical neighborhood effects + $\epsilon$

### Analogy model of reading

Nonword "Access" ~  lexical neighborhood effects + priming effects + $\epsilon$  

---

### Analogy model of reading

"Single-process, lexical analogy \[...\]the pronunciation of both words and non-words involves analogy with all possible known words sharing the appropriate segments" 

Kay & Marcel (1981, pg. 408)
