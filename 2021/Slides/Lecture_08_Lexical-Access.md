Word -> Meaning

---

### Aspects of lexical access

Recognition
Identification
Understanding
Naming


---

### Recognition

The word is familiar:

NIGHT is a word

NITE is not

---

### Identification

The word is distinguished from other words:

NIGHT is 

 - not MIGHT 
 - not NIGHTTIME
 - not NIGH
 - not KNIGHT


---

### Understanding

NIGHT *means* the time from sunset to sunrise

### Dual-route model

"...there is also the question of reading. We read in two ways; the new or unknown word is scanned letter after letter, but a common or familiar word is taken in at a glance, without bothering about the individual letters: its visual shape functions like an ideogram." -de Saussure, quoted in Coltheart, M. (2005)

### Problems with dual-route model

- Phonological neighborhood effects
- Phonological priming effects

### Phonological neighborhood effects

::: {.container}
:::: {.col}
A nice quiet neighborhood:
GAVE  
SAVE  
RAVE  
CAVE
::::
:::: {.col}
The wrong side of the tracks:
HAVE

Neighborhood effects compete with frequency effects

### Analogy model of reading



"Single-process, lexical analogy \[...\]the pronunciation of both words and non-words involves analogy with all possible known words sharing the appropriate segments" 

Kay & Marcel (1981), (pg. 408)
