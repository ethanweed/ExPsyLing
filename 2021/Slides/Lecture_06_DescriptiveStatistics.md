Statistical models:  

- Cannot tell us everything about the underlying process that generated the data
- Can (hopefully) allow us to make _some_ inferences about the underlying processes


---

Statistical models, data, and "reality"

- Data generated by a process 
- We want to divine the process that generated the data. 
- So we try out different models.

Key elements in the model: 

1. Central tendency
2. Variability

---

Measures of central tendency

- What is a measure of central tendency?
- What are the three main measures central tendency, and when should they be used?

How should you measure central tendency in:

- nominal data?
- ordinal data?
- interval or ratio data?

---

	If your data are *nominal scale*, you probably shouldn‚Äôt be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it‚Äôs probably best to use the **mode** instead.

---

	If your data are *ordinal scale*, you‚Äôre more likely to want to use the **median** than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger), but doesn‚Äôt depend on the precise numbers involved. That‚Äôs exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it‚Äôs not really appropriate for ordinal data.

---

	For *interval* and *ratio scale* data, either the **mean** or the **median** is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you‚Äôre trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you don‚Äôt have a lot of data), but it‚Äôs very sensitive to extreme values.

$$
\mbox{standard score} = \frac{\mbox{raw score} - \mbox{mean}}{\mbox{standard deviation}}
$$

z-scores (standard scores)

$$
z_i = \frac{X_i - \bar{X}}{\hat\sigma}

z-scores (standard scores)

- Converts scores to units of standard deviations
- Allows comparisons between unlike scores (e.g. scores of different units)
