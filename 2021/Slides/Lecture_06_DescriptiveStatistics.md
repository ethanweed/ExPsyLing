Statistical models:  

- Cannot tell us everything about the underlying process that generated the data
- Can (hopefully) allow us to make _some_ inferences about the underlying processes


---

Statistical models, data, and "reality"

- Data generated by a process 
- We want to divine the process that generated the data. 
- So we try out different models.

Mean / median / mode

Trimmed mean

If your data are nominal scale, you probably shouldn’t be using either the mean or the median. Both the mean and the median rely on the idea that the numbers assigned to values are meaningful. If the numbering scheme is arbitrary, then it’s probably best to use the Mode instead.

If your data are ordinal scale, you’re more likely to want to use the median than the mean. The median only makes use of the order information in your data (i.e., which numbers are bigger), but doesn’t depend on the precise numbers involved. That’s exactly the situation that applies when your data are ordinal scale. The mean, on the other hand, makes use of the precise numeric values assigned to the observations, so it’s not really appropriate for ordinal data.

For interval and ratio scale data, either one is generally acceptable. Which one you pick depends a bit on what you’re trying to achieve. The mean has the advantage that it uses all the information in the data (which is useful when you don’t have a lot of data), but it’s very sensitive to extreme values, as we’ll see in Trimmed mean.
