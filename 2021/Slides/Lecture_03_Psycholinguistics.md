"For Wundt \[...] the principal aim \[of psycholinguistics is] to explain spoken language and languages as a spontaneous product of consciousness, as an expression of mind." (Levelt, 2004)

"Language \[...] has come to refer to the practices of a linguistic community rather than the behavior of any one member. \[...] The behaviors of speaker and listener taken together compose what may be called a total verbal episode." (Skinner, 1957)

B.F. Skinner: _Verbal Behavior_

"The student who is learning to “spot” the composer of unfamiliar music or to name the artist or school of an unfamiliar picture is subjected to the same contingencies of differential reinforcement. Responses such as Mozart or Dutch are brought under the control of extremely subtle properties of stimuli when they are reinforced with “right” or punished with “wrong” by the community." (Skinner, 1957)

Noam Chomsky: Review of _Verbal Behavior_

"A typical example of stimulus control for Skinner would be the response to a piece of music with the utterance Mozart or to a painting with the response Dutch. These responses are asserted to be “under the control of extremely subtle properties” of the physical object or event. Suppose instead of saying Dutch we had said Clashes with the wallpaper, I thought you liked abstract work, Never saw it before, Tilted, Hanging too low, Beautiful, Hideous, Remember our camping trip last summer?, or whatever else might come into our minds when looking at a picture" (Chomsky, 1959)

To Review:

::: incremental
- Wundt: Language reflects internal processes
- Skinner: Language is behavior between people caused by associations
- Chomsky: Language reflects internal processes
- Connectionists: Language reflects internalized associations
- Social-cognitive theorists: Language is internalized associations created in a linguistic community
:::

So... what is psycholinguistics?



---
Some  (and only some) of the big questions:

- How do children learn language?
- How do find the words we know when we need them?
- How do we learn to read?
- How do we know what words mean in context?
