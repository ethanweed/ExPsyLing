## $Reading = Decoding \cdot Language Comprehension$

That decoding and linguistic comprehension are combined multiplica- tively captures the relationship of necessity coupled with non-sufficiency: progress in reading requires both components be non-zero. To highlight the difficulty involved in empirically assessing the multiplicative claim of the simple view, Figure 1 graphically depicts the relationship between decoding, linguistic comprehension, and reading comprehension, contrast- ing additive and multiplicative combinations of the two components. Note the gross similarities between the two graphs: in general, under each account, reading skill increases monotonically with increases in skill in either decoding, linguistic comprehension, or both. The relatively subtle difference in this context of overwhelming similarity is that no increase is found in reading skill under the multiplicative combination whenever decoding or linguistic comprehension is zero.


Two models:

Additive:
$R = D + LC$

Multiplicative:
$R = D \cdot LC$

In the additive model, some degree of LC will result in some degree of R, even if D=0. But this cannot be. You need _both_ D and LC for a gain in R.
