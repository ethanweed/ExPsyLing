				- Lexical decision task: Accuracy and Response Time
					- Response Time
						- Cognitive model: responding to a stimulus by tapping requires motor activity and cognitive activity.
						- Mathematical model: Response Time = Motor + Cognition
						- [[Experiment 1 models]]
							- 
							- Experiment 1a:
								- Tapping in response to cue vs. decision (color categorization)
								- $RT_{Perception} < RT_{Perception + Decision}$
							-  Experimennt 1b:
								- Color categorization vs. lexical decision (word / pseudoword)
								- $RT_{ColorCategorization} < RT_{LexicalDecision}$
