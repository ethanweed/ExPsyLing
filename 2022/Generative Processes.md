Generative Processes

Where do my data come from?

What is the process that produced my data

Traditional observation -> hypothesis -> experiment -> observation -> new hypothesis loop

Loop is a cyclic process

This is (in theory) the generative process that produces science (see many caveats)

Skinner: everything anybody says can in principle be predicted, because it is in fact a conditioned response to a stimulus. If you knew all the conditioning I had received over my lifetime, you could predict what I was going to say next.

Chomsky: that's silly. You have no way of knowing what I will say next. Present me with any stimulus, and I could say literally anything, or nothing at all. Go read a book.

As usual, there is a bit of truth to both of these. We cannot predict what, if anything, anybody will say in any given circumstance, but it is also not totally random what people say. Some utterances are more likely than others.
