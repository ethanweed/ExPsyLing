# Experimental Psycholinguistics

## Course Goals
In this course, we will learn to use experimental methodology and quantitative data analysis to investigate some of the cognitive phenomena that support language. More specifically, we will investigate the cognitive systems involved in visual word recognition. 

If this sounds complicated and abstract, that's because it is! The mind's chief activity "\[...\] consists in the endeavor to ascertain its own nature, the futility of the attempt being due to the fact that it has nothing but itself to know itself with." (<a

href="http://www.thedevilsdictionary.com" target="_blank">Bierce, 1911</a>). We can think all day about how the mind works, but to test our theories, we need to probe the mind experimentally.

To conduct psycholinguistic experiments, we need to translate theories to research hypotheses, and research hypotheses to statistical hypotheses. Put another way, we need to figure out how to design experiments that will let us measure invisible things in the mind that might or might not even exist. Yikes! This sounds like it would never work, but in fact it is possible, if we use the right methods and are careful in our interpretations.

The goals of the course are for you to learn to:

1. Understand the relationship between theoretical concepts and data
2. Operationalize theoretical concepts experimentally through measurable indices
3. Analyze and interpret findings in a critical way
4. Communicate experimental findings in a clear way to both expert and lay audiences

## What does this mean in practice?
There are three components to the course: _Lectures_, _Labs_, and  _Instructor Sessions_. You will demonstrate that you have achieved the course goals through the submission of a portfolio of your work. This portfolio is the exam.

### Lectures
In the lectures, we will discuss some models of word recognition, and discuss the experimental and statistical tools and background needed to investigate them. For the lectures, you will need to read, think, and be ready to discuss. 

### Labs
In the labs, you will primarily learn to use Python to do quantitative analysis of data. I will give you weekly lab assignments. The purpose of the lab assignments is to practice the technical skills you will need to complete the portfolio assignments for the exam. For the labs, you will need to have an open mind, and put in some time each week honing your programming and statistical skills.

### Instructor Sessions
Learning some programming and some statistics is an important part of the MA in Linguistics and in Cognitive Semiotics, but it can seem a bit overwhelming. That is why, in addition to the lectures and labs, there will also be _Instructor Sessions_, where there will be a teaching assistant available to give you practical support for your lab assignments. 

## Exam
The exam for this course is a portfolio of work completed throughout the semester, and will be graded on a pass/fail basis. Your portfolio will consist of:

1. Three lab reports, completed throughout  the semester, using the [lab report template](https://github.com/ethanweed/ExPsyLing/raw/master/2021/Resources/Experimental%20Report%20Template.doc)
2. Proof of completion of online GDPR course in either <a href="https://brightspace.au.dk/d2l/le/discovery/view/course/27011" target="_blank">Danish</a> or <a href="https://brightspace.au.dk/d2l/le/discovery/view/course/30198" target="_blank">English</a>
3. Design Your Own Experiment: Introduction and Methods sections for a proposed experiment on a topic of your choice
