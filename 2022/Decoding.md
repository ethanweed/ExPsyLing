Do word vs. pseudoword lexical access task (decoding)

RT to words
RT to non-words

```mermaid
graph LR
boxa(Is word)-->boxb(response time)
```

Obviously, the mere fact of the stimulus being a word or not does not cause the response time. It is mediated by some sort of cognitive structure.

```mermaid
graph LR
boxa(Is word)-->boxc(?)-->boxb(response time)
```

If the task is just to press a button in response to any stimulus, then we would expect that responses should be slower when no decision is required than when we need to decide on a word vs. a non-word.

```mermaid
graph LR
boxa(stimulus: word/nonword)-->boxb(task: respond immediately)
boxb(task: respond immediately)-->boxc(fast RT)
boxa(stimulus: word/nonword)-->boxd(task: make a decision)
boxd(task: make a decision)-->boxe(slow RT)
```


This leads us to [[Experiment 1 models]]
