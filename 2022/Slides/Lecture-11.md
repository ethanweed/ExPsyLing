During the 20th century, fishing boats became hugely more efficient so that it was possible to catch large quantities of fish in a short time. Towards the end of the century it became necessary to regulate fishing, for example by setting limits (quotas) on the catches of each fisherman or boat.

The analysis yielded the following main effects: a significant main effect of time, F(1, 201) = 184.6, p < .001; a nonsignificant effect of condition, F(1, 14) = 3.3, ns; and a nonsignificant effect of class within conditions, F(14, 201) = 1.3, ns. It is important to note that a highly significant interaction effect was found between time and condition, F(1, 14) = 22.7, p < .001, the size of this (training) effect was large (d = .92; Cohen, 1988).
