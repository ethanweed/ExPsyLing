The analysis yielded the following main effects: a significant main effect of time, F(1, 201) = 184.6, p < .001; a nonsignificant effect of condition, F(1, 14) = 3.3, ns; and a nonsignificant effect of class within conditions, F(14, 201) = 1.3, ns. It is important to note that a highly significant interaction effect was found between time and condition, F(1, 14) = 22.7, p < .001, the size of this (training) effect was large (d = .92; Cohen, 1988).
