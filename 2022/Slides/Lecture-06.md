#### Statistical models, data, and "reality"

- **Cannot** tell us everything about the underlying process that generated the data
- **Can** (hopefully) allow us to make _some_ inferences about the underlying processes

#### Statistical models, data, and "reality"

:::incremental
- Data are generated by a process.
- We want to divine the process that generated the data. 
- So we try out different models.

#### Modelling coin-flipping

𝑋∼Binomial(𝜃,𝑁)

<br>

- θ = probability of "success" on any given trial  

- 𝑁 = number of trials


---

$$
P(X | \theta, N) = \frac{N!}{X! (N-X)!}  \theta^X (1-\theta)^{N-X}
$$

#### Simulated coin-flipping

	import numpy as np
	x_20 = np.random.binomial(n=20, p=1/2, size=1000)
	x_100 = np.random.binomial(n=100, p=1/2, size=1000)
