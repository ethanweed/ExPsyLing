## Word superiority paradox

1. Words are composed of letters
2. So, to read words, we first have to identify the letters
3. But, we can read the letters faster if they are in a word
4. Which must mean that we identify the word _before_ we read the letters..?!?

1. The word superiority effect
2. The word frequency effect

## The word superiority effect



```{.mermaid format=svg  theme=neutral width=400 }
graph LR
A(word vs. non-word) -->B(RT for letter reading / identification)

```

## The word frequency effect



```{.mermaid format=svg  theme=neutral width=400 }
graph LR
A(word frequency) -->B(RT for word reading / identification)

```


---

## The semantic priming effect



```{.mermaid format=svg  theme=neutral width=400 }
graph LR
A(C A T) -->B(RT for word reading / identification of D O G)

```

---

## The masked repetition priming effect


```{.mermaid format=svg  theme=neutral width=400 }
graph LR
A(d o g ) -->B(RT for word reading / identification of D O G)
