Your teacher (me), you instructor, and your classmates are all here to help each other get better at coding. Getting the code to work is important, but do also take the time to make sure you understand what the commands are doing. This time, (with the exception of the Stroop challenge), all I've given you is the code to download the data. Then you are on your own. For the Stroop challenge, I gave the you code for the first stepâ€”after that, it's up to you :-)"
